# S60 distribution policy configuration file.
#
# File syntax:
# <path> : <policy>
#
# The order of path definitions is significant. Directories
# are matched to path definitions in the order they are defined here.
# The policy defined for the first matching path is taken into use.
# Path definitions which begin with keyword ROOT match from the
# beginning of the root directory, path definitions which begin
# with slash match anywhere in the path.
# Always use slash ('/') as a path separator in this file
# and do not end path definitions with a slash.
