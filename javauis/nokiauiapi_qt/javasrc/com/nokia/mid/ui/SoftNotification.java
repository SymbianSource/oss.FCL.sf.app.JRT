/**
 * <p>The <code>SoftNotification</code> is a class to manage soft
 * notifications. Soft notifications are reminders that inform the user of events
 * that have occurred in the user's absence, or while the user was busy with some
 * application. Text, and also graphics, can be used to communicate the message
 * to the user. Soft notifications are displayed as pop-ups in device home screen
 * (idle view).
 * Soft notifications are persistent and restarting the device does not delete
 * created soft notifications from the home screen.</p>
 *
 * <p>The user can respond to the soft notification by using the softkeys. The
 * softkey 1 is used for activating a function, for example opening a message
 * that has arrived. Application that created the soft notification will be activated
 * when the soft notification is accepted by the user. The softkey 2 is used to
 * discard the notification without taking any further action.</p>
 *
 * <p>The application that launched a soft notification can control it and also
 * discard it. It is possible to use the Applications key during a soft
 * notification; in that case, the soft notification disappears, but reappears
 * when the user returns to the device home screen, unless the application
 * responsible for the notification has discarded it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Grouping soft notifications</h3>
 *
 * <p>Soft notifications can be displayed for the user in two different appearances:
 * <li> <b>Ungrouped</b> soft notification (left figure): These notifications
 * contain one piece of information each. In ungrouped soft notification there can
 * be one or two lines of text and an image visible.
 * Ungrouped appearance is used when there's
 * only one active soft notification or the topmost soft notification does not
 * support grouping.
 * <li> <b>Grouped</b> soft notification (right figure): If there are several
 * soft notifications on the screen and they support grouping, the notifications
 * are grouped and shown as a list of notifications.
 * Only one line of text is shown per a notification and there are no images visible.
 * The user can pick up one notification at a time and react
 * to it. If user discards the notification group, then all the shown notifications
 * are discarded and are not to be shown again.</p>
 *
 * <p><img src="images/ungrouped.jpg" alt="Image of ungrouped soft notification.">
 * <img src="images/grouped.jpg" alt="Image of grouped soft notification."></p>
 *
 * <p>Soft notifications created through this API may be grouped with other
 * platform notifications if all of them supports grouping. A soft notification
 * supports grouping if <code>groupText</code> is given in
 * {@link #setText(String text, String groupText)}</p>
 *
 * <h3>Persistent notifications</h3>
 * <p>Soft notifications are persistent meaning that when an application
 * has created a notification and set it to the home screen, the notification
 * exists in the home screen until:
 * <li>User accepts the notification,
 * <li>User dismisses the notification, or
 * <li>Application removes the notification</p>
 *
 * <p>A soft notification stays on the device home screen even if the application
 * is closed or the device is restarted.</p>
 *
 * <p>Accepting (selecting) a soft notification created by an application causes
 * this application to be activated in the following ways:
 * <li>If the application was running on the background, it will be set to
 * the foreground.
 * <li>If the application was running and had registered a listener
 * for the notification,
 * {@link SoftNotificationListener#notificationSelected(SoftNotification)}
 * is called.
 * <li>If the application is not running, it will be started and set to the
 * foreground.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Notice</b> that accepting a notification belonging to a closed application
 * causes only the application to be started but does not
 * generate any listener events for the application. This is because there cannot
 * be any listeners registered by the closed application.
 * Thus, when an application is started by a notification, the application has
 * to decide which view is shown for the user without having the information about
 * the selected notification.</p>
 *
 * <p>Dismissing a soft notification does not bring the application to
 * the foreground or start the application neither. However, if a
 * listener has been set,
 * {@link SoftNotificationListener#notificationDismissed(SoftNotification)}
 * is called.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because soft notifications are persistent, they will remain on the home screen
 * even if the application is closed. It is possible to get access to these
 * notifications later when the application is restarted.
 * For accessing notifications later, the application has to store the IDs of
 * the notifications to a permanent memory (for example, RecordStore).
 * When the application is
 * restarted, the application may recreate those notifications by using the
 * stored IDs.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Notice</b> that since it is possible that the user has dismissed notifications
 * when the application was closed, it is not possible to know whether the
 * recreated notification still exist on the device home screen.
 * In many cases it may be worthile to first remove all those notifications
 * from the screen and then add only the needed ones back to the screen.</p>

 *        byte[] image = readImage( "mail.png" );
 *
 *        // Supports grouping since groupText is given here.
 *        iSoftNotification.setText( "You have 1 new mail", "1 new mail" );
 *        iSoftNotification.setSoftkeyLabels( "Show", "Exit" );
 *        iSoftNotification.setImage( image );
 *        iSoftNotification.post();
 *        }
 *
 *    public void notificationSelected(SoftNotification notification)
 *        {
